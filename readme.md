## Description
I don't feel like filling this out. its a game.

## Installation
maybe we could talk about pip and requirements and git.

## Rules
some rules here

## Ideas
If we give it a maximum of 2 datasets, and then make it so some people get a different different message depending on something, maybe where they are from 
Then we can make the duplication example be a system where if you organize your data into a more complex schema you could have an advantage and it wouldn't have to be an explicit rule to not have duplicated messages
